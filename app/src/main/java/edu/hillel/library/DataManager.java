The book became an instant classic, winning the 1995Software Development Jolt ColaAward for best book of the year. Now, inThinking in C++, Volume I, Second Edition, Eckel has thoroughly rewritten his masterpiece to reflect all the changes introduced in C++ by the final ANSI/ISO C++ standard. Every page has been revisited and rethought, with many new examples and exercises throughout -- all with a single goal: to help you understand C++ \"down to the bare metal,\" so you can solve virtually any development problem you encounter. Eckel begins with a detailed look at objects and their rationale, then shows how C++ programs can be constructed from off-the-shelf object libraries. This edition includes a new, chapter-length overview of the C features that are used in C++ -- plus a new CD-ROM containing an outstanding C seminar that covers all the foundations developers need before they can truly take advantage of C++. Eckel next introduces key object-oriented techniques such as data abstraction and implementation hiding. He then walks through initialization and cleanup; function overloading and default arguments; constants; inline functions; name control; references and the copy constructor; operator overloading; and more. There are chapters on dynamic object creation; inheritance and composition; polymorphism and virtual functions, and templates. (Bonus coverage of string, templates, and the Standard Template Library, can be found at Eckel's web site.) Every chapter contains many modular, to-the-point examples, plus exercises based on Eckel's extensive experience teaching C++ seminars. Put simply, Eckel has made an outstanding book on C++ even better. For all C++ programmers, and for programmers experienced in other languages who want to strengthen their C++ and object development skills.");
